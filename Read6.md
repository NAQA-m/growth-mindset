## How to specify colors
there are a lot of colors , mixed from three basic colors ( red , green and blue)
 we can specify any color in CSS by three ways


 1-**RGB values** 

RGB color system, constructs all the colors from the combination of the Red, Green and Blue colors. which have integer values from 0 to 255
For example, rgb(0, 0, 255) is rendered as blue, because the blue parameter is set to its highest value (255) and the others are set to 0.

 2- **HEX Codes**

Three byte hexadecimal numbers (meaning they consist of six digits), with each byte, or pair of characters in the Hex code, representing the intensity of red, green and blue in the color respectively.
   0000FF this is blue color code


 3- **Color names** 


pecify any color based on named and they are very limited in numbers

#### **In CSS we can specify color for background or treat any text to appear in a box with specify color**
