Pages 150 and 151 explain the evaluation of situation by comparing one value what you expect might be, there is a lot of type for comparisons: 

1-compare two value if they are same or aren't,  using (==  ,  !=)
2-compare two value if they are same or aren't and if they have same data type or haven't,  using (===  ,  !==)
3-  < , > ,  =< ,  >=  to compare the numbers 

Pages 156 and 157 explain logical operatrors , allow  you to compair one or more results of comparing one value what you expect might be

&& : This Is mean AND

|| : This Is mean  OR

! : This Is mean NOT

Pages  170-173  explain LOOPS, loops are used to execute a set of instructions/functions repeatedly when some conditions become true,the three common types of loops

FOR : using if you need to run the cod a specified number (number of iteration is not fixed)

WHILE :If the number of iteration is not fixed

DO WHILE : same 'while loop' but has one key difference (you must have to run the loop at least once)
